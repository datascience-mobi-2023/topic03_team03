## Topic 3: Proteome-wide Screen for RNA-dependent Proteins
#### Subtopic 3: HeLa Cells Synchronized in Interphase

First, we will load the dataset containing the mass spectrometry data from HeLa cells synchronized in interphase:

```{r}
RDeeP_HeLa_Interphase = read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm9bgsyg7cv6wu1/RDeeP_HeLa_Interphase.csv?dl=1", header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep = ";")
# i really dont know why changing "0" to "1" at the end of the url made it work, but it did
head(RDeeP_HeLa_Interphase)
View(RDeeP_HeLa_Interphase)


#Hi everyone!
