### About

In this project, we investigated RNA dependence in the human proteome by analyzing the protein distributions of 7086 genes in HeLa cells synchronized in interphase (data provided by Caudron-Herger *et al.*, 2020) (see **Figure 1**). The protein distributions were obtained from untreated and RNase-treated cell lysates separated on a sucrose gradient into 25 fractions. The proteins in each fraction were examined using mass spectrometry.
