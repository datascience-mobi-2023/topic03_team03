Data Analysis Project 2023
# Topic 3 : Proteome-wide Screen for RNA-dependent Proteins
## Subtopic 3: HeLa Cells Synchonized in Interphase
> Hannah Brehm, Johann Blakytny, Kira Hoffmann, Viktor Bonin

In this project we investigated the RNA-dependence of different proteins. To do this we analyzed the protein distributions of 7086 genes from HeLa cells synchronized in interphase (data provided by Caudron-Herger *et al.*). The protein distributions were obtained from untreated and RNase-treated cell lysates separated on a sucrose gradient and examined by mass spectrometry.
