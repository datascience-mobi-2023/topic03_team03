### About

In this project we investigated the RNA-dependency of different proteins. To do this we analyzed the protein distributions of 7086 genes from HeLa cells synchronized in interphase (data provided by Caudron-Herger *et al.*) (see **Figure 1**). The protein distributions were obtained from untreated and RNase-treated cell lysates separated on a sucrose gradient into 25 fractions and examined by mass spectrometry.
